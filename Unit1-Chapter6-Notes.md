# Chapter 6

## Functions
- We will see how to define a function
  - LOL - we've already done that multiple times.  WTF?
- Types
  - abstract, concrete, anonymous, high order, impure, etc.
- `???`
  - you'll implement later
  - helpful to focus on the design and types without
    - worrying about implementation
  - must set return type when using to help compiler
- Specifying default parameters
  - if params with defaults are listed first, they must be called
    - as a named parameter, e.g. `f(b = "Scala")`
- the last expresion is returned
- abstract functions have no implementation
  - `def myF(a: Int): Boolean // valid`
-
