# Chapter 10

## Access modifiers
- Use `private` to prevent access outside the class
  - Works with functions, values, and classes
- `protected`
  - Makes it accessible only from the class and subclasses
- use `public` (the default) sparingly
  - It alleviates confusion over entry points to your code
  - Preventing others from improperly overriding is a good thing
  - The more public you have the harder it is to change code later
    - because you won't be sure how other code is using it.
